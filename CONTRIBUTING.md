# Contributing to m8

Thank you for your interest! I am actively seeking constructive criticism to improve the codebase and make it more
idiomatic.

## Development Standards

- **Zig Version:** This project tracks Zig `0.15.2` (or current stable).
- **Code Style:** All code must be formatted using `zig fmt`.
- **Testing:** Ensure all tests pass by running `zig build test`.

## How to Contribute

- If you find a bug or a way to make the code more "Ziggy", you may open an issue first to discuss the approach or
simply submit a pull request.

2. **Implement** your changes. Keep PRs focused on a single feature or bug fix.
