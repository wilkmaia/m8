# m8

m8 is a CHIP-8 emulator ("interpreter" might be a more accurate word, but "emulator" is the standard used when talking
about CHIP-8) written in Zig.

This is nothing but a hobby project developed for learning purposes (both in Zig and emulating in general). There's no
higher objective behind it. That said, constructive criticism and contributions are encouraged.
